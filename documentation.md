# Web Research Agent - Documentation

## Agent Structure

The Web Research Agent is structured as a modular application with clear separation of concerns:

### 1. Core Architecture

The agent follows a layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: Frontend React components
- **API Layer**: Flask endpoints for communication
- **Service Layer**: Core agent functionality
- **Tool Layer**: Specialized tools for different tasks

### 2. Component Breakdown

#### Backend Components

## AI Prompt Design

While this implementation uses rule-based algorithms for demonstration purposes, it's designed to be easily integrated with AI models like OpenAI's GPT or similar. The prompt design follows these principles:

### 1. Query Analysis Prompts

For query analysis, prompts are structured to extract:
- Primary research intent (informational, instructional, comparative)
- Required information types (facts, opinions, recent news, historical data)
- Key entities and concepts to research

Example prompt template:
```
Analyze the following research query: "{query}"

1. What is the primary intent of this query? (informational, instructional, comparative)
2. What types of information would be most relevant? (facts, opinions, recent news, historical data)
3. What are the key entities or concepts that need to be researched?
4. What would be effective search terms to find information about this query?
```

### 2. Content Analysis Prompts

For content analysis, prompts are designed to:
- Evaluate relevance to the original query
- Extract key points and insights
- Assess reliability and potential bias

Example prompt template:
```
Analyze the following content in relation to the query "{query}":

Content: {content}

1. On a scale of 1-10, how relevant is this content to the query?
2. What are the 3-5 most important points from this content related to the query?
3. Is there any evidence of bias or reliability issues in this content?
4. What unique information does this content provide that should be included in a research report?
```

### 3. Information Synthesis Prompts

For information synthesis, prompts are structured to:
- Combine information from multiple sources
- Resolve contradictions
- Generate coherent summaries and conclusions

Example prompt template:
```
Synthesize the following information into a comprehensive research report about "{query}":

Source 1: {source1_content}
Source 2: {source2_content}
Source 3: {source3_content}
...

1. Provide a concise summary of the key findings (2-3 paragraphs)
2. Organize the information into logical topics or categories
3. Identify any contradictions between sources and explain how they might be resolved
4. Draw evidence-based conclusions from the information
5. Suggest what further research might be needed
```

## External Tool Integration

The Web Research Agent integrates with several external tools:

### 1. SerpAPI Integration

The agent uses SerpAPI for web searches:
- **Integration Point**: `web_search.py`
- **Data Flow**: 
  - Query is sent to SerpAPI with parameters for result count and language
  - Results are parsed and structured into a consistent format
  - Error handling includes fallback to mock results if API fails

Implementation details:
```python
def search(self, query: str, num_results: int = 10) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    try:
        # Prepare parameters for SerpAPI
        params = {
            "q": query,
            "api_key": self.api_key,
            "engine": "google",
            "num": num_results,
            "gl": "us",
            "hl": "en"
        }
        
        # Make the API request
        response = requests.get(self.base_url, params=params)
        
        # Process response...
    except Exception as e:
        # Error handling...
```

### 2. Web Scraper Integration

The agent uses BeautifulSoup for content extraction:
- **Integration Point**: `web_scraper.py`
- **Data Flow**:
  - URLs from search results are processed
  - HTML content is parsed with BeautifulSoup
  - Structured content is extracted including text, metadata, and links
  - Content is normalized for consistent processing

Implementation details:
```python
def scrape_url(self, url: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=self.headers, timeout=self.timeout)
        
        # Parse the HTML content
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        
        # Extract metadata and content...
    except Exception as e:
        # Error handling...
```

### 3. Frontend-Backend Integration

The frontend and backend communicate via RESTful API:
- **Integration Point**: `apiService.js` and `app.py`
- **Data Flow**:
  - Frontend sends research queries to backend API
  - Backend processes queries and returns structured results
  - Frontend renders results in user-friendly format

Implementation details:
```javascript
// Frontend API service
performResearch: async (query) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/research`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
        });
        
        // Process response...
    } catch (error) {
        // Error handling...
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

The Web Research Agent implements comprehensive error handling:

### 1. API Failures

- **Detection**: HTTP status codes and exception handling
- **Response**: Graceful degradation to mock data or cached results
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with suggested actions

Implementation:
```python
try:
    # API call...
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error performing search: {e}")
    # Fall back to mock results
    return self._generate_mock_results(query, num_results)
```

### 2. Content Extraction Issues

- **Detection**: Exception handling during scraping
- **Response**: Skip problematic sources, continue with available content
- **Logging**: Record issues for debugging and improvement

Implementation:
```python
try:
    # Content extraction...
except Exception as e:
    return {
        'success': False,
        'error': str(e),
        'url': url,
        'content': None,
        'metadata': None
    }
```

### 3. Invalid User Queries

- **Detection**: Input validation
- **Response**: Helpful error messages with examples of valid queries
- **Assistance**: Suggested query reformulations

Implementation:
```python
if not query or len(query.strip()) == 0:
    return jsonify({
        'success': False,
        'error': 'Query cannot be empty'
    }), 400
```

### 4. Network Connectivity Issues

- **Detection**: Request timeouts and connection errors
- **Response**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **User Feedback**: Status updates and estimated wait times

Implementation:
```javascript
// Frontend error handling
.catch(error => {
    loadingContainer.style.display = 'none';
    errorContainer.textContent = error.message || 'An error occurred while performing research';
    errorContainer.style.display = 'block';
    researchForm.style.display = 'block';
});
```

## Testing Scenarios

The Web Research Agent has been tested with various scenarios:

1. **Basic Informational Queries**: "Jupiter planet", "climate change effects"
2. **Complex Comparative Queries**: "electric vs gas cars environmental impact"
3. **Current Events Queries**: "latest AI developments 2025"
4. **Error Handling Scenarios**: Empty queries, malformed URLs, API failures
5. **Performance Testing**: Multiple concurrent requests, large result sets

Each scenario validates the agent's ability to:
- Correctly analyze query intent
- Find relevant information sources
- Extract and analyze content appropriately
- Synthesize information into useful reports
- Handle errors gracefully
